# About:
This repo is used for training on network automation concepts in a lab environment. I am hosting an EVE-NG VM and a Ubuntu Server VM on Azure cloud. 

I have 9 Cisco IOS routers connected in various ways, but each one has a management port in an isolated VRF that provides connectivity to my ubuntu server running ansible.
